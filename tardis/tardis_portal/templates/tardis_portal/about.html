<h1>About OAGR</h1>
</div>

<p class="lead">Online Ancient Genome Repository (OAGR) is an open access repository for ancient human DNA data.</p>

<p>It captures and catalogues ancient human genome and microbiome data, including raw sequence and processed data, along with metadata about its provenance and production. Included datasets are generated from ancient samples studied at the <a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/">Australian Centre for Ancient DNA</a>, <a href="http:/www.adelaide.edu.au/">University of Adelaide</a> in collaboration with other research groups.</p>

<p>Datasets and collections in OAGR are <a href="http://ands.org.au/discovery/opendata.html">open data</a> resources made freely available in a reusable form, using open file formats and licensed with minimal restrictions for reuse. Digital object identifiers (DOIs) are minted for included datasets and collections to facilitate persistent identification and citation.</p>

<p>Inclusion of data in OAGR is governed by the <a href="/about/repositoryguidelines">repository guidelines</a>.</p>
